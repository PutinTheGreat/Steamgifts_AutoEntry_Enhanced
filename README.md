# Steamgifts AutoEntry Enhanced

This script will automatically enter chosen giveaways on steamgifts.com. After installing, a new "Auto Entry" menu will show up on the main page of steamgifts.com. See the help menu for an overview on setting it up.

Tested only with Greasemonkey in Firefox. It may not work with other browsers or other script plugins.

# Notes

- This script should run fine with ESG. (works on my system and settings). I suggest disabling the setting "1.
  Enter/Remove button", since this code had that ability.

# Issues

- This script has for some users has issues entering the giveaways. The issue seems to be if another steamgifts page is opened after the one used to enter giveaways. Work around is only have 1 steamgifts page opened at a time.
- Known issue "sometimes" the settings dropdown doesn't work, refreshing page should help with that.

# Todo

- Remove giveaways your currently in if you set it to 0 max entries
- Remove giveaways your currently in if you have already won/own the game

# Suggestions

- Remove 1 click button if on the blacklist/Dim the giveaway on the page
- Exporting settings into a readable format, with line breaks n shieeet!
- Prepend a numbering column to the wishlist and enable editing the list order by manual input in said column. Just like the steam wishlist .
- Point stacking. Enter any (longest first) GAs instead hitting the 300p cap. Upon next refresh when finding potential wishlist GAs, leave the parked ones to reclaim the necessary points.
